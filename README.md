# WildApricot

This contains an alternate version of Steve Warren's generate-acls.py script that works with the Wild Apricot DB and API.

It also has the payline2WA_payments.py script that allows generating "manual" payments for Wild Apricot from a csv file generated from the payline portal. This is meant to be used at the start of the month to capture the "legacy" payline subscriptions into Wild Apricot financials.
